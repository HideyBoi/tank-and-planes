# Tank and Planes

[itch.io page](https://hideyboi-dev.itch.io/tank-and-planes)

> Made for Kenney Jam 2021
Using pixel shmup, top down tanks redux, crosshair pack, and ui pack from [Kenney's website](https://kenney.nl/assets)


Fast paced top down shooter.

You've got to get out of the war zone as fast as possible, but oh no, you've gotten yourself stuck on some barricades! You can't quite move, but you can still turn! Shoot down the enemy planes before they destroy you!

>This is my first published godot game and second ever published game. I'm really proud of this one, music sucks doe. I enjoyed working with Kenney's assets a whole lot, there's so many cool things on his website.
